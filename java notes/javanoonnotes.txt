STRONGLY TYPED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:
The pgm lang.will test the type of var. during compile time phase.
     EG:C,C++,java,C#,groovy
WEAKLY TYPED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:
The pgm lang.will test the type of var.during runtime phase
     EG:js,groovy,scala,python..
---------------------
Thr variable type is diff. from value type.
RULES:
byte,shots.int,long----value type is by default is int(4 byte) 
byte b=10(int)
if there is a exess of 1 byte then it is call overflow.
for addopting that one byte is called casting.
by using casting there is a possiblity of loss of values.
--->float ,double
float is small,double is big
EG:float f=100.89f----> this f is used to do conversion.
EG:  double d=333.20
---->char
the character will be stored in 16 bit called uniq code character.
STRING:
Collection of character.
EG: String name="sound";
